                            Hello my friends! May I introduce myself?
                            If you allow then I will introduce myself.

                            My name is Danaryko Al-harits. I used to be called Danar by my friends. Maybe I will tell my experiences and stories about me here.

                            I've been in school since the age of 7 years in Islamic boarding schools from elementary to high school.
                            During the 12 years of schooling at the Islamic<br><br>boarding school I knew little about technology. Therefore, I really want to understand about modern technology. Then enter me into this field of 
                            <br><br>informatics. When I first started college I had a hard time understanding programming language lessons, but I have a strong motivation to continue to increase my 
                            <br><br> curiosity about technology.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            After 3 years I studied in the field of informatics on Institut Teknologi Indonesia, I learned a lot about programming code.
                            One of them is html, css, and <br><br>javascript.
                            <br><br>And for me all programming languages ​​are not too difficult if you want to try hard to learn, and gain for experience. Because if u just
                            <br><br>want to be able to but don't do it, then it's just bullshit and pointless.
